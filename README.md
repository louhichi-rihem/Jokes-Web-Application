# Jokes-Web-Application

Design a dynamic web database application utilizing ASP.NET Core (ASP.NET MVC) through Visual Studio, implemented with the C# language. 
This innovative web platform enables users to effortlessly register using their email addresses and engage in activities such as contributing jokes or searching for humorous content. 
I meticulously crafted a Jokes model along with its corresponding properties, integrated specialized functions within the joke's controller, and meticulously developed multiple views to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience.
